# **Functional Traits**

Classification of the gelatinous macrozooplankton abundant in the North Sea and Sk-
agerrak/Kattegat has been done based on their key traits relating to what determines
their performance in terms of feeding, reproduction, growth and survival (Fig table below).

In order to represent the key traits of gelatinous zooplankton in terms of their
feeding, survival, growth and reproduction, information was collected from
available literature. Due to a longtime lack of attention towards the gelatinous zoo-
plankton community, literature is limited. Whenever possible, original research arti-
cles were used for specific species. If no such exists, trait classification was inferred
from studies investigating closely related and morphologically similar species. In the
case neither exists, the trait has been left out of the analysis.

The final selection of traits include 10 traits with detailed information provided in the sections below the figure.

### **Benthic stage**
Some gelatinous zooplankton have a benthic stage in their life cycle. The benthic stage
is a life stage in which polyps settle on hard substrate and reproduces asexually. This
asexual reproduction give rise to pelagic medusa that sexually reproduces in the water
column. The asexual reproduction can also produce podocysts. Podocysts can enter
a dormant stage and withstand unfavorable conditions and have a longer survival
period than other life stages of the jellies. Podocysts can also clone themselves via
budding.[13]
The benthic stage is a life history trait as it is a part of the life cycle of the species
having it. As an example, Aglantha digitale, a highly abundant specie in the North
Sea, does not have a benthic stage.[1] The ecological functions of the trait are both
survival and growth & reproduction. The trait functions as survival as it is used for
surviving unfavorable conditions as podocysts. The trait further functions as growth
& reproduction as it as mentioned is a asexual reproduction stage.

### **Bioluminescence**
Bioluminescence as a trait which function is still not completely clarified and widely
discussed in literature but it is thought to be involved in all three ecological function
groups; feeding, survival, growth and reproduction.[9] Bioluminescence can be caused
by consumption of certain food sources such as dinoflagellates but some species can
also perform bioluminescence on their own synthesising a substrate (luciferin) that is
oxydized by an enzyme (luciferase) and thereby releasing light.[9]
Bioluminescence is involved in feeding as a mechanism for attracting prey. Some
species are seen to stretch their tentacles and illuminate them from which prey are
attracted towards the tentacles and hence they can catch the prey.[6]
Bioluminescence is involved in survival as some species produce light to confuse
predators and escape. This is done in multiple ways, e.g. some species can release
thousands of glowing particles that acts as decoys for confusing, whereas others use it
to make a glowing slime that stick to their predators which makes them visible to their
own predators.[20]
Finally, bioluminescence is involved in reproduction as it is used for communi-
cation and localization of mates.[35] Thereby bioluminescence has an impact on 3 life
history traits, namely feeding, reproduction and survival.

### **Carbon content**
Carbon content of wet weight is an interesting trait as there is an increasing interest and
focus on carbon sequestration by the gelatinous zooplankton community.[23] Carbon
content as % of WW varies by several orders of magnitude across species and groups.
In general, 0.05% carbon content of wet weight for ctenophores and 10 times higher for
cnidarians with 0.5% carbon content of wet weight.[14] The average carbon content of
wet-weight for the investigated species is 0.29%. The carbon content trait is made in
two steps. First, the species for which carbon % of wet weight is giving in [24], they
have been giving this measurement. Second, the carbon content of the other species are
based on an average of the carbon % of wet weight for their taxonomy in [24]. Carbon
content is a trait placed as morphological since it alters due to shape and life stage

### **Feeding mode**
The feeding mode of the gelatinous zooplankton is defined in the categories; ambush
feeder, feeding-current feeder, cruise feeder, raptorial feeder and feeding-current feed-
er/ambush feeder is added. The feeding mode tells what strategy an animal uses to
find and consume prey. This is thus a behavior of the animal that effects feeding. The
feeding mode is also a trait that effects survival as there are different risks of predation
associated with the different feeding modes. The risks arise from the hydrodynamic
signal produced during feeding that predators can pick up and locate. The different
feeding modes produces different levels of hydrodynamic signal.[17] Further feeding
mode is also a trait for growth, as there is also different prey consumption rates and
prey selection associated with the different strategies. [21]

Ambush feeding can be both passive- and active. Passive ambush feeding is
passive encounter of prey due to motility of the prey. Active ambush feeding is 
passive encounter of motile prey where capture is made by active attacks. Ambush
feeding has a low predator risk as they do not cause much disturbance in the water so
it can be hard for predators to know that they are there. Ambush feeder goes after their
prey when they feel the prey is there. This means that they only target motile prey. [21]
Feeding-current feeding is a feeding mode where the animal creates a feeding
current that transport the prey in a laminar feeding current towards the capture sur-
faces and thereby increases the search volume in comparison to a ambush predator.[17]
Mnemiopsis leidyi is in its adult stage a feeding-current feeder where it uses its auricles
to create this current. The predation risks is higher with this feeding mode, as preda-
tors can also feel the feeding current and hence knows that the animal is near.
Feeding-current feeder/ambush feeder is a feeding mode that indicates that the
species changes feeding mode throughout its life cycle, e.g. Mnemiopsis leidyi. In the
juvenile stage Mnemiopsis leidyi is a tentakulate ambush predator whereas after it un-
dergoes metamorphosis and develops auricles and lobes it feeds through a feeding-
current.

Cruise feeding is a feeding mode where the animal slowly and unregularly swim
in the water and feeds on whay they encounter. E.g. Aurelia aurita is cruise feeder, that
catches prey to encounters with its large bell shape.
Raptorial feeding is a feeding mode where the whole prey is consumed at once.
Beroe spp. are an examples of raptorial gelatinous feeders that engulf other jellies whole
by enlarging their own body around their prey or bite off small pieces of other jellies.[8]

### **Intra-guild predation**
The intra-guild predation trait is a trait that classifies whether or not a species feed on
other jellies. Some species live solely off other gelatinous zooplankton, e.g. Beroe spp.,
whereas other species prefers to eat other gelatinous zooplankton but does also have
other food sources, e.g. Cyanea capillata. This means that the trait do not distinguish
for selectivity of jellies as a food source. This is due to uncertainty in literature as to
how selective different species eat jellies.

### **Maximum size**
The maximum size is a trait classified in three categories; small, intermediate and large.
The three classifications are based on the maximum size a species possibly can be and
fit in three intervals for the categories. A maximum size classified as small is below
5mm. A maximum size classified as intermediate is between 5mm-20mm. A maximum
size classified as large between 20mm-1.5m. The maximum size of a specie tells about
both feeding, survival and growth. It influences feeding as it determines which prey
possibilities a species has. Survival is influenced the other way, as it tells about which
predators it can have, hence what species are able to feed on it. Lastly it tells about
growth, as it is the size of a specie.

### **Metamorphosis**
Metamorphosis is a process where the species changes its shape. This trait therefore
denote whether or not a specie undergoes metamorphosis as a part of its growth during
its life history.

### **Polyp stage**
Polyp formation is a reproductive life stage for some species. Other species are only
medusaes. The polyps can be in the water column which is why it is not the same as
the benthic stage. The polyp stage is an asexual reproductive life history event.

### **Propulsive mode**
The propulsive mode tells about how the specie moves in water by itâ€™s internal forces.
Species with a muscular swimming bell are capable of producing internal propulsive
motions which are categorized as either jetting or rowing. Further for this trait, there
is a category termed cruising which are the species without swimming bells that hence
do neither but cruises in the water. The propulsive mode is determined by the mor-
phology which is why it is in this trait type. The ecological functions of the propulsive
mode is both feeding and survival as the motion in water influences both the predation
capabilities and escape capabilities.[4]

### **Transparency**
Transparency is a trait describing whether or not a species is transparent. Some species
have color, e.g. Cyanea capillata has a red bell and tentacles and Cyanea lamarckii has
a blue bell and tentacles, these are therefore not classified as transparent. Mnemiopsis
leidyi is a specie that is classified as transparent as it contains no color. Transparency is a
survival trait as being transparent reduces the encounter rate with visual predators.[21]

### **Vertical migration**
Vertical migration is migration downwards in the water column. This can e.g. happen
as a migration downwards during the day to hide from the light and then a rising
towards the surface during the night to feed. This is a behavior some species exhibit
and a survival strategy as it can reduce the encounter rate with visual predators.[21]
