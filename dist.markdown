# **Species Distributions**

On this page you can find the spatial distributions of the different species, both shown as the data used for the analysis; log(Ind.1000m3), and Ind.1000m3, Ind.m2, WW(g).m2 and WW(g).m3. Ind.=individuals pr. volume/area, also called the abundance. WW=wet weigth pr. volume/area, also called the biomass. The data is showed both pr. m2 and m3 as ways are used in ecology depending on whether you wish to consider the entire water column (m3 = volume) or only the view from above like a bird (m2 = area). 

The data shown is for IBTS-Q1 2021, 2022 and 2023. The data collected is done by both Denmark and Sweden for all years, and Germany for 2023.
