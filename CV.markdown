# Curriculum Vitae (CV)

Soon-to-be MSc. Ocean Engineer from DTU (April 2025) specializing in biological oceanography and data analysis üåäüê†üíª. Passionate about understanding biological systems through data visualization and analysis.

Currently researching plankton ecology at the Centre for Gelatinous Plankton Ecology and Evolution at DTU Aqua, developing statistical frameworks for zooplankton trait analysis to model biodiversity in climate change contexts.
