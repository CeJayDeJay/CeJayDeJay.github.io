# Artworks and experience

Art has always been a big part of my life, and I dream of combining artistic methods with the communication of oceanography.

I have a three-year-long (2013-2016) pre-academy education (BGK) from Kulturskolen in Esbjerg. During this education, workshops and projects across various media were taught by artists (Marble sculpturing, Granite sculpturing, Wood sculpturing and installation construction, Collages (mixed media), Painting, Croqui, Video and sound, Photography). Further communication of artworks has been a key part of the education, together with planning and setting up exhibitions.

The main focus for my independent work during BGK has been sculpturing, collages, and paintings. In recent times, I have mainly worked with digital drawing, as this has been used for my scientific papers and presentations.

From 2016-2017 I was involved in working for the Danish artist Kirstine Roepstorff. Here I mainly worked with producing fabric collages and assisting in the production of larger paintworks. This work gave me insights into running an art studio and the production of larger exhibitions, as she presented Denmark at the 2017 Venice Biennale of Art. Further, I have worked together with the artist Viron Erol Vert to build Ambereum at Roskilde Festival in 2022.
