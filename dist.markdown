On this page you can find the spatial distributions of the different species, both shown as the data used for the analysis (log(Ind.1000m3)) and Ind.1000m3, Ind.m2, WW(g).m2 and WW(g).m3. 

The data shown is for IBTS-Q1 2021, 2022 and 2023. The data collected is done by both Denmark and Sweden for all years, and Germany for 2023.
